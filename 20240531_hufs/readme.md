## Structure of the Talk

The lecture is divided into four main parts, each designed to build upon the other to provide a comprehensive view of the significance of coding in education:

1. **Technology to Classroom?**
   - Examine the gradual yet impactful shift toward software-centric teaching tools in education, contrasting it with the slower adoption of physical technology in classrooms. Highlight how coding emerges as a crucial skill, underpinning the successful integration of technology in today’s teaching environments.

2. **Multimodality and language teaching**
   - Discuss how coding integrates into language teaching by enhancing multimodal learning strategies, which foster greater engagement and deeper understanding through diverse sensory experiences.

3. **Coding to the classroom**
   - Practical demonstrations on how coding can be utilized by educators to create dynamic content and manage classroom activities efficiently.

4. **Teacher qualifications in the digital era**
   - Provide detailed strategies for educators on how to acquire and integrate coding skills into their teaching practices, addressing potential challenges and highlighting the benefits of a multidisciplinary approach.


## Demonstration on Colab

During the lecture, I will demonstrate practical coding exercises using Google Colab. These examples will showcase how simple coding techniques can be used to:
- Create interactive learning materials.
- Automate routine educational tasks.
- Analyze educational data to improve teaching strategies.

Join me in exploring how we can transform the classroom into a vibrant, technology-enabled space where education meets innovation.
