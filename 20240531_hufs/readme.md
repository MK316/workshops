## 📙 Structure of the Talk

The lecture is divided into three main parts, each designed to build upon the other to provide a brief introduction of the significance of coding in education:

1. **Technology to Classroom?**
   - Examine the gradual yet impactful shift toward software-centric teaching tools in education, contrasting it with the slower adoption of physical technology in classrooms. Highlight how coding emerges as a crucial skill, underpinning the successful integration of technology in today’s teaching environments.

2. **Multimodality and Education**
   - Discuss how coding integrates into language teaching by enhancing multimodal learning strategies, which foster greater engagement and deeper understanding through diverse sensory experiences.

3. **Coding to the Classroom: Demonstration of Coding for classes**
   - Practical demonstrations on how coding can be utilized by educators to create dynamic content and manage classroom activities efficiently.


Join me in discovering ways to turn the classroom into an engaging, tech-enhanced environment where learning and innovation come together.
