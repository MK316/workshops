## 📙 Structure of the Talk

The lecture is divided into three main parts, each designed to build upon the other to provide a brief introduction of the significance of coding in education:

1. **Technology to Classroom?**
   - Examine the gradual yet impactful shift toward software-centric teaching tools in education, contrasting it with the slower adoption of physical technology in classrooms. Highlight how coding emerges as a crucial skill, underpinning the successful integration of technology in today’s teaching environments.

2. **Multimodality and Education**
   - Discuss how coding integrates into language teaching by enhancing multimodal learning strategies, which foster greater engagement and deeper understanding through diverse sensory experiences.

3. **Coding to the Classroom: Demonstration of Coding for classes**
   - Practical demonstrations on how coding can be utilized by educators to create dynamic content and manage classroom activities efficiently.
